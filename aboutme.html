        them out on iitR memes fb page ! (links at the end. gotta wait, read my description then see my memes. Dont
        Skip.) Well, Will any one begin his intro this way? Nope ? But, I did. So whats ur guess about my year ? <br>
        Yea . I am first yearite at IIT_R (unoffically)
        <br>What ? unoffically is what u might be thinking right . Haha, I never have been to campus till now, My
        College - MS Teams would be a better version of answer. <br>
        Okay, Okay.. Lets dive into my hobbies.
        I cook a little . Its especially because i love to cook and have food ! biriyanis are always &hearts;.
        I make memes. I collect coins and stamps . Call me Philatelist.Gaming has always been an option for me to relax
        and chillout. COD pc series, i love it ! U one among them ? Do wire to me ! lets have a fun match.
        <br>First sem, went fine ! Decent CG . I dont want to get more into studies here. Its boring af , right ? Agree
        ? . LOL.
        <br> I do competetive programming and am a developer at SDSLabs. <br>
        Aiming to become admin of IITR Memes, have fun, biriyanis, code a little, have a fat pay . Thats akk in all.
